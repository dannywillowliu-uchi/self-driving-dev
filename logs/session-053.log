[Thu 12 Feb 2026 01:05:02 CST] Phase 23: worktree=/Users/dannyliu/personal_projects/autonomous-dev-scheduler/.worktrees/phase-23 session=053
Phase 23 is already complete. Here's the summary:

**Phase 23: Fix shell injection in recursive_planner.py + zombie process leak**

Both fixes were already implemented and merged to main (the worktree was cleaned up by the orchestrator):

1. **Shell injection fix in `recursive_planner.py`** (line 180-192): Uses `create_subprocess_exec` with `stdin=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE` and passes the prompt via `proc.communicate(input=prompt.encode())`. No shell string interpolation of untrusted data.

2. **Zombie process fix in `session.py`** (line 212-216): The `TimeoutError` handler calls `proc.kill()` + `await proc.wait()` (with `ProcessLookupError` guard) before returning, ensuring no zombie Claude sessions.

3. **Tests exist**:
   - `test_llm_uses_stdin_not_shell_interpolation` - verifies shell metacharacters in scope/objective don't cause injection
   - `test_llm_timeout_returns_fallback_and_kills_process` - verifies planner timeout cleanup
   - `TestSpawnSessionTimeout.test_timeout_kills_subprocess` - verifies session timeout kills subprocess

The `.phase-result.json` has been written with success status.
