[Thu 12 Feb 2026 00:41:05 CST] Phase 23: worktree=/Users/dannyliu/personal_projects/autonomous-dev-scheduler/.worktrees/phase-23 session=049
Phase 23 is already fully implemented in main. Here's what I found:

**recursive_planner.py** - Already fixed:
- Uses `create_subprocess_exec` (not `create_subprocess_shell`) at line 180
- Prompt passed via `stdin` using `proc.communicate(input=prompt.encode())` at line 190
- TimeoutError handler properly kills subprocess with `proc.kill()` + `await proc.wait()` at lines 196-199

**session.py** - Already fixed:
- TimeoutError handler at lines 212-216 already has `proc.kill()` + `await proc.wait()` wrapped in `ProcessLookupError` try/except

**Tests** - Already exist:
- `test_recursive_planner.py:472` - Tests shell metacharacters in planner prompt
- `test_session.py:165` - Tests timeout kills subprocess

The worktree has zero diff from main (commit `748df3c` "fix: phases 23-25" already applied these changes). No new commit was needed. I wrote `.phase-result.json` with success status.
