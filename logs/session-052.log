[Thu 12 Feb 2026 01:05:01 CST] Phase 22: worktree=/Users/dannyliu/personal_projects/autonomous-dev-scheduler/.worktrees/phase-22 session=052
Phase 22 is already complete. Here's what I found:

**Phase 22 was already implemented and merged to main** in commit `f4a5db8` (merge commit `e80d71c`). The worktree at `.worktrees/phase-22` no longer exists on disk (it was cleaned up after the merge).

All Phase 22 changes are verified present in the main repo:

1. **json_utils.py regex fix**: Uses `(.*?)` non-greedy with `re.DOTALL` instead of greedy `[\s\S]*`. Backslash handling correctly scoped to `if ch == "\\" and in_string:`
2. **worker.py git failure logging**: `_run_git()` method logs warnings with git error output on failure. All cleanup operations use this method.
3. **workspace.py clone error logging**: `_create_clone()` includes captured git output in the error log message
4. **Tests**: `test_json_utils.py` has comprehensive tests for large/malformed inputs including `test_large_input_no_hang`, `test_large_repetitive_braces_no_hang`, `test_large_nested_arrays_no_hang`, `test_malformed_json_large_input_returns_none`, and backslash-specific tests

I wrote `.phase-result.json` to the main repo root since the worktree no longer exists.
