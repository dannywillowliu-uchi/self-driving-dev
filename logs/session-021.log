[Wed 11 Feb 2026 21:17:54 CST] Starting execution session 021
Session complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

**Phase 15 (completed):** Added per-unit timeout and verification command overrides:
- `timeout` and `verification_command` columns added to DB schema (CREATE TABLE, insert, update, _row_to_work_unit)
- Tests: 3 DB round-trip tests (insert/get with overrides, None defaults, update) + 2 worker prompt override tests + 2 mission worker prompt tests

**Discovery mode (completed):** Ran the 3-step analysis pipeline:
1. `analyze_codebase` -- 52 files, 8490 LOC, 0.93 test-to-code ratio, 29 gaps identified
2. `research_best_practices` -- matched 8 actionable gaps to best practices, scored by priority
3. `generate_improvement_proposals` -- produced 3 new backlog phases

**New backlog phases added:**
- **Phase 16:** Narrow exception handlers in round_controller.py and coordinator.py (checkpoint: true)
- **Phase 17:** Test coverage for models.py and backend modules (ssh, local, container) (checkpoint: true)
- **Phase 18:** Resolve TODO/FIXME markers in discovery.py (checkpoint: true)
