[Wed 11 Feb 2026 23:18:28 CST] Starting discovery session 034
Discovery complete. Here's a summary:

**Discovery Session 018 Results**

The static analyzer found the same 26 gaps as last session (all known false positives). A deep Opus-level audit of all 21 source files found 12 genuine issues. After manual verification, I added 3 new phases to BACKLOG.md:

| Phase | Issue | Severity | Category |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **36** | Merge queue snapshots both taken on feature branch -- before/after comparison is meaningless, regressions go undetected | Medium | Correctness bug |
| **37** | SSH backend `provision_workspace` and `release_workspace` missing `shlex.quote()` despite `spawn()` already using it | Critical (defense-in-depth) | Security |
| **38** | Worker doesn't clean up workspace on success path (stale branches accumulate) + `LocalBackend.checkout -b` fails silently on unit retry | Medium | Resource leak + bug |

All 3 phases are marked `checkpoint: true`. The remaining 9 audit findings (stall detection regression blindness, backend pool initialization, stdout buffer growth, coordinator monitor race, etc.) are lower priority and can be picked up in a future discovery cycle.
