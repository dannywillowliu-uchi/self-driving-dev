[Wed 11 Feb 2026 22:00:49 CST] Starting execution session 024
## Session Summary

**Discovery + Phases 23-25 completed.** Commit `748df3c` in autonomous-dev-scheduler.

### What was done:

**Discovery:** Deep audit via Opus subagent found 18 issues, 7 verified as genuine. Added 3 new phases to BACKLOG.md.

**Phase 23 (Security):**
- Fixed shell injection in `recursive_planner.py` -- switched from `create_subprocess_shell` with string interpolation to `create_subprocess_exec` with stdin piping (same pattern as the green_branch.py fix from Phase 21)
- Fixed zombie process leak in `session.py` -- added `proc.kill()`/`proc.wait()` on timeout

**Phase 24 (Data Correctness):**
- Fixed `LocalBackend.get_output` data loss -- the final stdout read for completed processes never executed because the buffer dict key was always present (initialized at spawn). Added a `_stdout_collected` set to track collection state
- Added `asyncio.Lock` to `GreenBranchManager.merge_to_working` to prevent concurrent git operations from corrupting the shared workspace

**Phase 25 (Logic Errors):**
- Added `unit.attempt += 1` to all 6 failure paths in `RoundController._execute_single_unit`
- Fixed off-by-one: `mission.total_rounds` is now set before `_should_stop` check
- Upgraded `parse_mc_result` to use `extract_json_from_text` for multiline JSON support

**10 files modified, 287 insertions, 46 deletions.**

### Blocked:
- Could not run verification suite (pytest/ruff/mypy) due to persistent permission denials for `.venv/bin/*` commands. Please run `bash run_verify.sh` manually to confirm all tests pass.
