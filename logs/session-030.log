Discovery cycle complete. Here's a summary:

**Discovery Results for `autonomous-dev-scheduler`:**

- Analyzed 53 source files (9,482 LOC), test-to-code ratio 1.048, 99% type hint coverage
- 27 raw gaps found, but 26 were false positives (TODO/FIXME in string literals, backend tests in combined test file, trivial `__init__.py` files)
- **1 genuine gap**: `except Exception:` at db.py:474 (transaction rollback handler)
- Added **Phase 35** to BACKLOG.md: narrow the exception type to `sqlite3.Error` (low priority, checkpoint enabled)

The codebase is in excellent shape after 34 phases of hardening. The only remaining finding is a cosmetic improvement to an already-correct pattern (catch-rollback-reraise).
